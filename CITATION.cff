abstract: >-
  A risk factor model of BMI is an important building block
  of health simulations aimed at estimating government
  policy effects with regard to overweight and obesity. We
  created a model which generates representative population
  level distributions and which also mimics realistic BMI
  trajectories at an individual level so that policies aimed
  at individuals can be simulated. The model is constructed
  by combining several datasets. First, the population level
  distribution is extracted from a large, cross-sectional
  dataset. The trend in this distribution is estimated from
  historical data. In addition, longitudinal data are used
  to model how individuals move along typical trajectories
  over time. The model faithfully describes the population
  level distribution of BMI, stratified by sex, level of
  education and age. It is able to generate life course
  trajectories for individuals which seem plausible, but it
  does not capture extreme fluctuations, such as rapid
  weight loss.
